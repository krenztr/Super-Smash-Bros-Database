\section{Index and Glossary}
\textbf{Assigned to}: Developer ultimately responsible for the implementation of a feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Effort}: Expectation of the resources and time consumed for a feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Exact Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined by strict equality with the search input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Feature}: A system capability that fulfills a user need (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Flow}: A particular series of ordered steps through a sequence of events in a use case (\pageref{flow}).\\ \\
\textbf{Fuzzy Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on similarity to the original search input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Post-condition}: An expectation of the system's state after the events in a use case occur (\pageref{post_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Pre-condition}: An assumption about the state of a system before a use case's events are followed (\pageref{pre_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Priority}: Description of how essential a feature is to the project (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{REST}: Stands for ``Representational state transfer;'' is a style software architecture often used in servers for simplicity and scalability. Amongst other aspects of REST, it is stateless. This means each request sent from the client of the server that uses REST to the server does not require any information from any previous requests. All information required to fulfill the request must be sent with the request (\pageref{rest}).\\ \\
\textbf{Risk}: Probability that a feature will instigate delays in the project (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Scenario}: A possible permutation of a set of flows that lead from one flow to another (\pageref{scenario}).\\ \\
\textbf{Stability}: Likelihood that the understanding of a feature will change (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Target Release}: Expected release iteration of a testable feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Test Case}: Specifies what the expected result of a series of actions will have in a system (\pageref{test_case}).\\ \\
\textbf{Universal Product Code (UPC)}: a specific kind of barcode assign uniquely to each item in the server (\pageref{upc}).\\ \\
\textbf{Use case}: A description of the steps performed by a user and system that leads the user towards a useful outcome (\pageref{use_case}).\\ \\
\textbf{Wildcard Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on adherence to the user's given search pattern (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
